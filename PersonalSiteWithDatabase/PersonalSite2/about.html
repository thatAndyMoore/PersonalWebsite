			Well, what can I say about myself? Let's start with 'hello.' Hello, my name is Andrew. You always need to start with hello. So, how are you doing? Are you comfortable? Do you need anything to eat? Drink? Are you sure? Well this isnt weird at all... </br></br>
			
			So let's talk about me I guess. </br></br>
			
			My name is Andrew, and I study Computer Science at La Roche College. Before I started to attend LRC, I wore several diffrent hats. I was a DJ, a camp counslor, and for a breif time, I would test drive and blog about cars for GM. Isn't that neat? Here's a photo of one of the cars they lent me:

			In my free time, I like to listen to music, play video games, build computers, and go hang out in the great outdoors.</br></br>
			
			I also have in intrest in photography, but I wouldn't really call myself a photographer. Nevertheless, all the background photos on this site are photos that I took.
