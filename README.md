PersonalWebsite
===============

A personal webpage that I created for a web-programming class. Incorporates HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, and some MySQL

Some of the content on the pages is just trivial filler text that I mind-vomited instead of just using "Lorim Ipsum."

I was more conserned with makeing the code work, than I was about actuall page content (I.e writing a real "About Me") as I am not planning on having this page go 'live.'

Please refer to this as an example of my codeing skills, and not as an example of my skills as a blogger.
